## Welcome to Your Gaming Adventure

Ready to build your very first game? This is where your journey into game development begins! You're about to create the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python and your new AI coding buddy - GitHub Copilot. It will be right there to help you every step of the way. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a working game that you built yourself (with a little AI magic)! 

## 🎯 What You'll Do

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- **Create your first game** - Build a working Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python
- **Partner with AI** - Use GitHub Copilot as your coding assistant
- **Understand game logic** - Learn how games make decisions and handle player input
- **Run Python programs** - Execute your code and see it come to life!

## ✅ Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- ✅ **Access to GitHub Copilot** - Your AI coding partner
- ✅ **A Codespace or VS Code** - Your development environment
- ✅ **Curiosity and excitement** - The most important ingredient!

> **💡 Pro Tip:** This lesson uses a special CodeTour feature that will guide you step-by-step. Think of it as your GPS for coding!

### 🎯 Your Coding Journey Preview

Here's what your CodeTour will teach you - but remember, the interactive experience is much more fun!

#### Step 1: 👋 Welcome & Setup
Your CodeTour will introduce you to the magic of GitHub Copilot and Rock, Paper, Scissors!

#### Step 2: 🎯 Give Copilot Context  
You'll write your first comment to tell Copilot what you're building:
```python
# Write a rock, paper, scissors, game
```

Then you'll ask Copilot to help import what you need:
```python  
# import random module
```

#### Step 3: 🧠 Create the Game Logic
You'll prompt Copilot to build the main function:
```python
# define main function that handles all the logic
```

#### Step 4: ▶️ Make It Run
You'll tell Copilot to start your game:
```python
# call main function  
```

#### Step 5: 🎉 Play Your Game!
Run your code with `python3 main.py` and watch your creation come to life!
