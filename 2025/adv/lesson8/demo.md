Beginning:
Where is the story set? What’s the problem?

Middle:
How does the AI help? What happens?

## 🎨 Step 3: Generate images & videos

For each scene in your storyboard, write a prompt.

| Scene     | Example Prompt (edit to fit your story)                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Beginning | `A quiet animal shelter at dusk. Rows of anxious dogs. A staff member installs a small AI speaker that lights up.` |
| Middle    | `The AI plays gentle music. Dogs calm down. One stops pacing and lies down. Staff look amazed.`                    |
| End       | `A family adopts a dog. At home, they record a loving voice message. The AI turns it into a calming melody.`       |

**Replace these with your own scene prompts:**

```
Beginning:
[ ]

Middle:
[ ]

End:
[ ]
```

Generate:

* At least **5 images** (key story moments)
