# üé® AI Storytelling Handout ‚Äì Build Your Own AI for Good Story <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->


## üìå Overview
Work step-by-step with **Copilot** to create a meaningful **AI for Good** story. You'll brainstorm an idea, write a storyboard, generate images, write a narration script, and assemble a video using **Clipchamp**.

## üé¨ Objective:
By the end of this activity, students will:

Develop a short script telling a story of how AI could help people, animals, or the planet.

* Use AI tools (like AI Foundry, Copilot, Sora, or other generative tools) to:
* Generate at least 5 images to illustrate key moments.
* Produce 2 short AI-generated videos (e.g., concept demos, animations, or mood clips).
* Create 2 audio narrations (e.g., voice-over for intro & outro).
* Combine these into a 60-second final video that tells an AI for Good story.

### ‚úÖ Deliverable:
* One 60-second AI for Good story video
* Must include:
  * At least 5 AI-generated images
  * 2 short AI-generated videos
  * 2 audio narrations
  * Original script (submitted as text)

### üéì Example Video - **Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs**

This demo presents a storyboard prompt for 'Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs'. The concept involves an AI music generator that detects dog emotions and plays calming music. The storyboard outlines the beginning with anxious dogs in a shelter, the calming middle with responsive music, and the heartwarming end where a dog finds a home, highlighting the comfort AI can provide.

Title: üê∂ Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs
Concept: An AI music generator that detects a dog‚Äôs emotional state through sounds and movement, then plays music that helps calm them.
Storyboard Prompt:
Beginning: A busy animal shelter in the evening. Dogs bark anxiously in their kennels. A shelter worker installs a small AI-powered speaker that lights up as it detects noise.
Middle: The speaker begins to play soft, responsive music that adjusts based on the dogs‚Äô moods. Barking slows. One nervous puppy sits quietly, ears perked. Another curls up and dozes.
End: A family adopts one of the dogs. At home, they record a loving voice message. The AI turns it into a calming melody. The dog listens, tail wagging, finally at peace.
Message: AI can bring comfort and connection‚Äîeven to those without a voice.

#### **Step 1: Brainstorming an ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù Idea**

**Objective**: Generate a creative idea that solves a real-world problem using AI.

> [!NOTE]
> * Use [AI4Good story ideas](/2025/adv/storytelling_with_ai/AI4Good_story_ideas.md) for inspiration if you like
> * Use Copilot to come up with ideas [Copilot chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/)

### üß† **Initial Prompt (typed into [Copilot](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/)):**

> ```
> Give me an idea for an AI for Good tool that helps animals in shelters.
> ```

<details>
<summary>üì¨ **See what Copilot suggested**</summary>

- ‚ÄúAI camera that tracks dog behavior and sends alerts to shelter staff.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAn app that predicts when a dog is stressed or anxious.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAI-generated music to calm barking dogs.‚Äù

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìù **My Thought Process (click to expand)**</summary>

- I liked the third idea‚Äî**music for anxious dogs**‚Äîbecause it felt emotional and visual.
- I imagined dogs barking, and the AI sensing noise and calming them in real-time.
- I made the idea more specific by adding **location** (kennels), **input** (dog emotion from sound/movement), and **output** (custom music).

</details>


### ‚úÖ **Finalized ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù Idea:**

> ```
> A custom AI music app placed in kennels to calm dogs when they‚Äôre upset.
> ```

#### **Step 2: Writing the Storyboard Prompt**

**Objective**: Clearly structure your idea into a detailed storyboard prompt.

### üìã **Storyboard Prompt Template:**

```
Title: [Name + emoji]
Concept: [What‚Äôs the AI for Good idea in 1‚Äì2 sentences?]

Beginning:
Where is the story set? What‚Äôs the problem?

Middle:
How does the AI help? What happens?

End:
What‚Äôs the outcome? Who benefits?

Message:
What does this story say about AI helping the world?
```

### üß† **Initial Prompt I Gave Copilot:**

> ```
> Write a short storyboard (using the storyboard template below) about an AI speaker that calms dogs in a shelter by playing relaxing music when they are upset.
>

> 

<details>
<summary>üì¨ **Copilot's Initial Response (click to expand)**</summary>

- **Beginning:** A loud animal shelter filled with barking.
- **Middle:** A new AI speaker is tested. Music begins playing. Dogs become calmer.
- **End:** One dog stops barking and lies down.
- **Message:** AI can improve animal welfare.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìù **My Feedback & Edits (click to expand)**</summary>

- Too short and vague.
- Needed **scene detail** (What time of day? What do we see/hear?)
- Needed **emotion** (Which dog? What‚Äôs the outcome?)
- Needed an **emotional arc** and **clear message**.

</details>


### ‚úÖ **Final Storyboard Prompt (Ready for Copilot Create or Clipchamp):**

```

#### **Step 4. Create Video in Clipchamp**

<!-- tabs:start -->  

#### **1. Create new Video in Clipchamp**

Go to [Clipchamp](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/launch/Clipchamp/?auth=2) and select Video Project to create a new video 

![Output](https://nfl24cdn.azureedge.net/nflblob/bsmp25/bsmp25_week3_STWAI/lesson8/clipchamp_create_new_vid.png)


#### **2. Import and Organize Generated AI Assets**

Import all the Images, Videos and Audio, etc. that was generated in the previous steps to your video project.

Use Clipchamp (or another editor) to:

* Combine images, videos, and narration

* Add captions, titles, and music if time

* Aim to keep it under 60 seconds.

#### **Step 5. Generate Story Audio Narration in Copilot**

Use Copilot to generate audio using your storyboard add in `[üìù Prompt:] Please write a natural, warm, 1-minute narration script (for text-to-speech) based on this storyboard prompt. Keep it simple, emotional, and easy to read aloud.` with your storyboard prompt like below. 

Take generated narration from copilot and add in audio into your video in clipchamp using text to speech. 


> use our storyboard prompt üìù in copilot to generate 60 second narration:
>
> `Please write a natural, warm, 1-minute narration script (for text-to-speech) based on this storyboard prompt. Keep it simple, emotional, and easy to read aloud.`
> 
> `Storyboard Prompt: Title: üê∂ Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs
Concept: An AI music generator that detects a dog‚Äôs emotional state through sounds and movement, then plays music that helps calm them.
