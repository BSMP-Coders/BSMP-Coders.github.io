# 🎨 AI Storytelling Handout – Build Your Own AI for Good Story <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->


## 📌 Overview
Work step-by-step with **Copilot** to create a meaningful **AI for Good** story. You'll brainstorm an idea, write a storyboard, generate images, write a narration script, and assemble a video using **Clipchamp**.

## 🎬 Objective:
By the end of this activity, students will:

Develop a short script telling a story of how AI could help people, animals, or the planet.

* Use AI tools (like AI Foundry, Copilot, Sora, or other generative tools) to:
* Generate at least 5 images to illustrate key moments.
* Produce 2 short AI-generated videos (e.g., concept demos, animations, or mood clips).
* Create 2 audio narrations (e.g., voice-over for intro & outro).
* Combine these into a 60-second final video that tells an AI for Good story.

### ✅ Deliverable:
* One 60-second AI for Good story video
* Must include:
  * At least 5 AI-generated images
  * 2 short AI-generated videos
  * 2 audio narrations
  * Original script (submitted as text)

## ✅ Step 1: Brainstorm Your “AI for Good” Idea

**Objective:** Generate a creative idea that solves a real-world problem using AI.

**Prompt to type into Copilot:**  
> Give me an idea for an AI for Good tool that helps animals in shelters.

**Copilot's Response:**  
`[Paste Copilot's idea here]`

**My Thought Process:**  
`[Reflect on the idea and how it could help]`

**Finalized “AI for Good” Idea:**  
`[Write your final idea here]`

## ✅ Step 2: Write Your Storyboard Prompt

**Objective:** Structure your idea into a detailed storyboard prompt.

### 📋 Storyboard Prompt Template
```
Title: [Name + emoji]
Concept: [What’s the AI for Good idea in 1–2 sentences?]
Beginning: Where is the story set? What’s the problem?
Middle: How does the AI help? What happens?
End: What’s the outcome? Who benefits?
Message: What does this story say about AI helping the world?
```

**Prompt to type into Copilot:**  
> Write a short storyboard using the template below about an AI speaker that calms dogs in a shelter by playing relaxing music when they are upset.

**Copilot's Response:**  
`[Paste Copilot's storyboard here]`

**My Feedback & Edits:**  
`[Write your edits or improvements]`

**Final Storyboard Prompt:**  
`[Write your final storyboard here]`

## ✅ Step 3: Generate Storyboard Images with Copilot

**Objective:** Create at least 5 images that visually represent your storyboard.

For each scene, type a prompt into Copilot like:  
> Generate an image for the beginning scene: a busy animal shelter in the evening with anxious dogs barking.

Repeat for each scene (Beginning, Middle 1, Middle 2, End, Message).

**Paste or describe each image below:**
- **Image 1:** `[Paste Copilot-generated image or describe it here]`
- **Image 2:** `[Paste Copilot-generated image or describe it here]`
- **Image 3:** `[Paste Copilot-generated image or describe it here]`
- **Image 4:** `[Paste Copilot-generated image or describe it here]`
- **Image 5:** `[Paste Copilot-generated image or describe it here]`

## ✅ Step 4: Write the Narration Script

**Objective:** Write a short narration for each image to tell your story.

- **Narration for Image 1:** `[Write your narration here]`
- **Narration for Image 2:** `[Write your narration here]`
- **Narration for Image 3:** `[Write your narration here]`
- **Narration for Image 4:** `[Write your narration here]`
- **Narration for Image 5:** `[Write your narration here]`
