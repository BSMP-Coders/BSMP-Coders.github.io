# DC Weather Analysis (Janâ€“Mar 2025)

This project guides students through analyzing real-world weather data from Washington, DC using Python and GitHub Copilot.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Learn data analysis basics
- Load and explore weather data
- Clean and structure datasets
- Perform statistical analysis
- Visualize trends using seaborn python libraries
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist with coding

Data was sourced/scraped from:
https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/KJPN/date/2025-1


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

When diving into data analysis, there's a mental checklist seasoned analysts instinctively run throughâ€”like muscle memory. Here's a refined list of pro tips to sharpen your analysis and spot insights that others might miss:

ðŸ§¹ 1. Start with a Clean Sweep
Check for missing values: Look for patternsâ€”missing completely at random (MCAR) vs. not at random (MNAR) matters.

Identify outliers: Useful for deeper insight or flagging data quality issues.

Verify data types: Numeric stored as text? Dates misformatted? Catch these early.

Deduplicate: Remove or investigate duplicates that might skew results.

ðŸ§­ 2. Understand the Data Context
What was the original purpose of this data?

How was it collected (survey, sensor, scraped, manual input)?

Are there any known biases (sampling, confirmation, survivorship)?

Talk to stakeholders: A 10-minute chat often unlocks insights buried in metadata.

ðŸ“ˆ 3. Always Explore Before Modeling
Summary stats: Mean, median, mode, std dev, rangesâ€”start simple with basic statistics.

Distributions: Visualize histograms to see shape and skew.

Correlations: Use heatmaps, scatterplotsâ€”but watch for odd relationships.

ðŸŽ¯ 4. Focus on Relevance, Not Just Significance
Statistically significant vs. practically meaningful to a user (avoid p-value obsession).

Look for business impact: Would this insight change a decision?

ðŸ§  5. Don't Trust, Verify
Cross-validate results: Sanity-check trends across different slices of data or sources.

Baseline comparisons: Use control groups or past periods to frame findings.

Version control: Track transformations to preserve reproducibility. Can anyone replicate your results.

ðŸ§© 6. Think in Stories, Not Just Stats
What's the narrative? Why does this matter? So what?

Use visuals to support a pointâ€”not just to decorate a dashboard.

Research counterarguments in your storytelling, pre-emptively to build credibility.

## ðŸ§  Pro Tip for Analysts
When choosing a visualizaton charts, always start with the question you're answering:

Are you comparing values?

Showing change over time?

Revealing relationships?

Displaying distribution?

Highlighting composition?

## ðŸ§  Other possible data sources? There is data galore to research with copilot, e.g.
https://resources.data.gov	- Directory of federal agency data hubs (e.g., NASA, CDC, DOJ)	Deep dives into specific domains like health, energy, and justice

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets - Thousands of datasets across domains like health, finance, sports, and more
