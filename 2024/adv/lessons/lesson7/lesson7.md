### Instructions:

1. Go to the Custom Vision website: https://customvision.ai/.
1. Sign in with your Microsoft account.
1. Click on the "Create Project" button.
1. Select "Image Classification" as the project type.
1. Enter a name and description for your project.
1. Select a domain for your project. The domain will determine the type of images that your project can classify.
1. Click on the "Create" button.
1. Upload your images to your project.
1. Label your images.
1. Train your model.
1. Test your model.
1. Deploy your model.

### Here are some additional tips:

* Use a variety of images for your project. The more images you have, the better your model will be.
* Label your images carefully. Make sure that each image is labeled with the correct tag.
* Train your model for a few iterations. This will help your model to learn the features of the images.
* Test your model on a set of unseen images. This will help you to determine how well your model is performing.
* Deploy your model to a web service. This will allow you to use your model to classify images in real time.
