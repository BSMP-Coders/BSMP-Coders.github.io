Welcome to the BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program! Your adventure into coding begins here, as we explore GitHub, VS Code, and Streamlit. Ready to unlock your coding prowess and start creating? 🌟  
   
## Objective 🎯  
   
Our aim is to familiarize you with GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and Streamlit. You'll finish this lesson by building a "Hello World" web app, marking your entry into the world of programming!  
   
## Lesson Overview 📖  
   
- **GitHub and GitHub Codespaces**: Get to grips with version control and cloud-based development.  
- **VS Code**: Uncover the capabilities of this powerful code editor.  
- **Streamlit**: Learn how to create a simple web app using Streamlit.  
   
## Resources You'll Need 📚  
   
Before we dive in, make sure you have these resources at your fingertips:  

- Your first GitHub repository: [Lesson 1 GitHub Repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOJR07ei)  
- Dive into "Python and Streamlit Basics" with our Jupyter notebook: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/BSMP-Coders/lesson1-streamlit-hello-world/blob/master/python_and_streamlit_basics.ipynb)  
   
## GitHub Codespaces: Your Coding Playground in the Cloud ☁️🛠️  
   
GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, cloud-hosted dev environment to code directly in your browser.  
   
### Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces 🌐  
   
1. Head to the [Lesson 1 GitHub Repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOJR07ei) and initiate your Codespace.  
2. Get to know the repository. The `app.py` file is where we'll code our Streamlit app.  
3. Run your app with a simple click in Codespaces and witness it come to life!  
   
## Why We ♥️ Streamlit  
   
- **Super Simple**: Just a few lines of Python and you've got a web app!  
- **Instantly Reactive**: See your changes happen live.  
- **Totally Customizable**: Play with widgets and features to personalize your app.  
   
## Python Basics Quick Guide 📘  
   
Let's quickly cover some Python basics that will power your Streamlit app:  
   
- **Variables**: Store and utilize data with ease.  
- **Imports**: Access libraries like Streamlit to add superpowers to your code.  
   
```python  
import streamlit as st  
   
# This is a variable holding a string  
greeting = "Welcome to Streamlit!"  
```  
   
### Activity: Your First Streamlit App 🛠️🎉  
   
Your mission: Build a Streamlit app that extends a warm greeting. Incorporate titles, headers, and interactive widgets to make your app engaging.  
   
**Sneak Peek of the Code:**  
```python  
import streamlit as st  
   
st.title("Hello World from BSMP Coders! 🌍")  
st.header("The Adventure Begins")  
st.write("Welcome to your first Streamlit app. Let the fun begin!")  
```  
   
**Your Tasks:**  
- Add a subheader for style.  
- Include text input to ask for a name and greet the user.  
- Choose an interactive widget from the [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and integrate it into your app.  
   
## Submitting Your Work 📤  
   
Crafted your app? Fantastic! Now, navigate to the Homework page to submit your creation. We're eager to see what you've come up with!  
   
## Ready, Set, Code! 🏁  
   
You're now equipped with the tools and knowledge to start coding. Remember, all great coders began as novices. Let's dive in and create something incredible!
