## Flask Basics Review üìù

Flask is a lightweight, easy-to-use web framework for Python. Let's quickly revisit the core concepts:

### Basic Flask Commands

1. **Setting Up a Flask Server**: Use `Flask` to create a basic web server.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import random

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
    def _live():
        return "Alive!"

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['GET'])
    def predict():
        demo = random.randint(2000, 5000)
        return str(demo)

    app.run(port=5005)
    ```

2. **Running the Flask Server**: Use the terminal to run your Flask application.

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Building the Flappy Bird Game üõ†Ô∏è

Let's build a simple Flappy Bird game using Flask and GitHub Copilot.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Flask Application Structure**: Create the necessary directories and files.

    - `flappybird/`
      - `app.py`
      - `templates/`
        - `index.html`
      - `static/`
        - `style.css`
        - `game.js`

2. **Create Flask Routes**: Set up routes to serve the HTML page and static files.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return render_template('index.html')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

3. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Game**:
    - **index.html**: Create a canvas element and link the CSS and JavaScript files.
    - **style.css**: Style the game elements.
    - **game.js**: Implement the game logic using JavaScript.

4. **Using GitHub Copilot**:
    - Open your code editor and start typing code.
    - Copilot will provide suggestions, which you can accept by pressing `Tab` or `Enter`.

5. **Modifying the Game**: Use the following activities to modify the game.
    - **Activity 1**: Increase the gap between pipes.
    - **Activity 2**: Reduce the gravity affecting the bird.
    - **Activity 3**: Slow down the speed of the pipes.

## Using GitHub Copilot üåü

GitHub Copilot can assist you in generating code for your Flask application. Here's a prompt to guide Copilot:

```
Build a Flappy Bird game using Flask as the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. The game should have:
- A canvas element for rendering the game.
- A bird that the player can control with the spacebar.
- Moving pipes that the bird must avoid.
- A scoring system to keep track of the player's score.
```

By providing clear and specific prompts, you can leverage Copilot to write and modify code efficiently.
