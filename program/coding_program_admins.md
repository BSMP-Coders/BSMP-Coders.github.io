## Preparing for Class 🧑‍🏫  
   
### Pre-Class Preparation 📝  
1. **Access to Materials**: Ensure all students have access to the course deck. If access is not available, provide assistance.  
2. **Course Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the course deck, including past student projects and course objectives, for a comprehensive understanding of the course direction.  
3. **Technical Setup**: Ensure students have GitHub accounts and are familiar with GitHub classrooms. Spend initial class time setting up.  
4. **Prepare the Coding Lesson**: Complete the homework assignments and reading materials.  
5. **Join the Meeting**: Ensure you have video on and audio off.  
   
### Coding Office Hours 🕒  
- **Optional Attendance**: Mondays and Fridays.  
   
## During Class 🎓  
   
### Lesson Plan Flow 🗂️  
1. Start with an overview of the homework assignment.  
2. Introduce the lesson concept.  
3. Conduct activity/reflection.  
4. Introduce the next homework assignment.  
   
### Breakout Sessions 💬  
- **Purpose**: Facilitate local sessions for students to present thoughts on activities, reflection, and share homework solutions.  
- **Structure**: After breakout sessions, rejoin the main call to continue with the class.  
- **BAM Mentors**: Responsible for creating the breakout rooms.  
   
## Final Student Video Coding Project 🎥  
   
The final student video coding project is a key component of the BSMP24 Advanced Coding Program. Here are the key points:  
   
### Project Criteria 📜  
- Must be a video presentation.  
- At least 5 minutes long.  
- Demonstrate understanding of coding and Python.  
- Must be creative and original.  
   
### Key Points from Instructor Meeting 📝  
1. **Distinct from Hackathon**: The student video project presentation is distinctly different from the hackathon projects.  
2. **Presentation Schedule**: The last Tuesday of each chapter is dedicated to the student video project presentation. No planned activities on the following Thursday due to the hackathon day.  
3. **Chapter-Level Facilitation**: Each chapter is encouraged to facilitate the coding video projects on the last Tuesday, utilizing class time for this purpose.  
   
For more detailed criteria, refer to [Final Projects](https://bsmp-coders.github.io/#/lessons/student_video_project/final_projects).  
   
### Submission 📤  
- Students must submit their video by the last Tuesday of the BSMP chapter before class.
