# Python Basics for Streamlit  
   
Welcome to the Python basics guide! Here, we'll cover the essentials you need to power up your Streamlit apps with Python. Let's get started! 🚀  
   
## What is Python? 🐍  
   
Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. It's perfect for web apps, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more!  
   
## Variables in Python 📦  
   
Variables are like labeled jars where you can store data like numbers, text, lists, and more.  
   
```python  
# A variable storing a number  
age = 16  
   
# A variable storing text  
welcome_message = "Hello, Streamlit!"  
```  
   
## Functions in Python 🛠️  
   
Functions are like recipes. You give them ingredients, and they give you something back. They help you reuse code and stay organized.  
   
```python  
# A simple function to greet someone  
def greet(name):  
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Streamlit."  
```  
   
## Importing Libraries 📚  
   
Libraries are collections of pre-written code that you can use to add functionality to your Python programs.  
   
```python  
# Importing the Streamlit library  
import streamlit as st  
```  
   
## Your First Python Script for Streamlit 🎉  
   
Let's write a simple script that uses what we've learned:  
   
```python  
# Import the Streamlit library  
import streamlit as st  
   
# A variable for our greeting  
greeting = "Welcome to the BSMP Coding Class!"  
   
# A function to display the greeting  
def show_greeting():  
    st.write(greeting)  
   
# Calling the function to display the greeting  
show_greeting()  
```  
   
Now you're ready to use these Python basics to create amazing things with Streamlit!
