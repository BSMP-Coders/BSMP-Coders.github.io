## Basics for Writing Effective Prompts

Clear and descriptive prompts help generate videos closer to your intended vision. Begin by identifying your core idea, then refine it by adding relevant keywords and modifiers.

Include the following elements in your prompt:

1. **Subject**: The main object, person, animal, or scenery featured in your video.
2. **Context**: The setting or environment in which the subject appears.
3. **Action**: The activity or movement of the subject (e.g., walking, running, turning their head).
4. **Style**: The visual style or aesthetic. You can specify general styles or detailed film styles (e.g., horror film, film noir, cartoon-style render).
5. **Camera Motion** *(optional)*: The camera's movement or perspective (e.g., aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, low-angle shot).
6. **Composition** *(optional)*: The framing of the shot (e.g., wide shot, close-up, extreme close-up).
7. **Ambiance** *(optional)*: The mood created by color and lighting (e.g., blue tones, night, warm tones).

## Additional Tips for Crafting Prompts

Use these tips to further enhance your prompts and achieve better results:

- **Use descriptive language**: Incorporate adjectives and adverbs to clearly illustrate your vision.
- **Provide context**: Include background details when necessary to help the model understand your intent.
- **Reference artistic styles**: Mention specific artistic styles or art movements if you have a particular aesthetic in mind.
- **Leverage prompt engineering tools**: Explore prompt engineering resources and tools to refine your prompts. For more information, see [Introduction to prompting](#).

**Enhancing Facial Details**: To improve facial clarity in personal or group images, explicitly mention facial details by including terms like "portrait" in your prompt.
