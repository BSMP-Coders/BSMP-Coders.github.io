## ✅ **Step 1: Brainstorming an “AI for Good” Idea**

**Objective**: Generate a creative idea that solves a real-world problem using AI.

### 🧠 **Initial Prompt (typed into Copilot):**

> ```
> Give me an idea for an AI for Good tool that helps animals in shelters.
> ```

<details>
<summary>📬 **See what Copilot suggested**</summary>

- “AI camera that tracks dog behavior and sends alerts to shelter staff.”
- “An app that predicts when a dog is stressed or anxious.”
- “AI-generated music to calm barking dogs.”

</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 **My Thought Process (click to expand)**</summary>

- I liked the third idea—**music for anxious dogs**—because it felt emotional and visual.
- I imagined dogs barking, and the AI sensing noise and calming them in real-time.
- I made the idea more specific by adding **location** (kennels), **input** (dog emotion from sound/movement), and **output** (custom music).

</details>

### ✅ **Finalized “AI for Good” Idea:**

> ```
> A custom AI music app placed in kennels to calm dogs when they’re upset.
> ```

---

## ✅ **Step 2: Writing the Storyboard Prompt**

**Objective**: Clearly structure your idea into a detailed storyboard prompt.

### 📋 **Storyboard Prompt Template:**

```
Title: [Name + emoji]
Concept: [What’s the AI for Good idea in 1–2 sentences?]

Beginning:
Where is the story set? What’s the problem?

Middle:
How does the AI help? What happens?

End:
What’s the outcome? Who benefits?

Message:
What does this story say about AI helping the world?
```

### 🧠 **Initial Prompt I Gave Copilot:**

> ```
> Write a short storyboard (using the storyboard template below) about an AI speaker that calms dogs in a shelter by playing relaxing music when they are upset.
>

> ```
> 

<details>
<summary>📬 **Copilot's Initial Response (click to expand)**</summary>

- **Beginning:** A loud animal shelter filled with barking.
- **Middle:** A new AI speaker is tested. Music begins playing. Dogs become calmer.
- **End:** One dog stops barking and lies down.
- **Message:** AI can improve animal welfare.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 **My Feedback & Edits (click to expand)**</summary>

- Too short and vague.
- Needed **scene detail** (What time of day? What do we see/hear?)
- Needed **emotion** (Which dog? What’s the outcome?)
- Needed an **emotional arc** and **clear message**.

</details>

### ✅ **Final Storyboard Prompt (Ready for Copilot Create or Clipchamp):**

```
Title: 🐶 Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs  
Concept: An AI music generator that detects a dog’s emotional state through sounds and movement, then plays music that helps calm them.  

Beginning: A busy animal shelter in the evening. Dogs bark anxiously in their kennels. A shelter worker installs a small AI-powered speaker that lights up as it detects noise.  

Middle: The speaker begins to play soft, responsive music that adjusts based on the dogs’ moods. Barking slows. One nervous puppy sits quietly, ears perked. Another curls up and dozes.  

End: A family adopts one of the dogs. At home, they record a loving voice message. The AI turns it into a calming melody. The dog listens, tail wagging, finally at peace.  

Message: AI can bring comfort and connection—even to those without a voice.
```

## ✅ **Step 3: Copy Storyboard images to PowerPoint**


**Objective**: Save all images to powerpoint deck (one per slide).

1. Create a empty powerpoint (in Copilot Create there is a tab for `Create PowerPoint`).
2. Copy and Paste each image from the storyboard to the powerpoint slide
3. You should have 4-5 slides with each of the storyboard images 


---

## ✅ **Step 4: Create AI Video Story Using Microsoft Copilot Create (or Clipchamp)**

**Objective**: Use the finalized storyboard prompt from Step 2 to create visuals for your story.

✅ **Tip:** You can directly reuse the finalized storyboard prompt (Step 2) in Copilot Create or Clipchamp to guide image selection and slide sequencing.

### 🧠 **Use Copilot Create Video and reuse the Storyboard Prompt:**
