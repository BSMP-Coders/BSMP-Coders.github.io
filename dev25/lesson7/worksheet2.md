# 🧠 **AI Storytelling Handout**

## *Learn to Think, Build & Create with AI for Good*

Welcome to **AI Academy** – where we use AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to create stories that help animals, people, and the planet. In this project, you’ll **engineer prompts** to generate a storyboard, images, and video narration.

---

## 🚀 **Step 1: Brainstorm an “AI for Good” Idea**

AI for Good = An AI system that solves a real-world problem.
Think: empathy + creativity + impact!

### ✍️ Try Prompting Copilot:

> “Give me 3 creative ideas for how AI could help \[animals / students / the environment / mental health].”

### 💭 Your Notes:

* What *type* of problem do you want your AI to solve?
* Who or what will benefit from this AI?

---

## 🔧 **Step 2: Build Your Story Idea** (Prompt Engineering Practice)

Use this prompt scaffold to build your own story idea.
You’ll give this to Copilot to generate a **storyboard**.

---

### 📄 Storyboard Prompt Template

```
Title: [Creative name + emoji!]
Concept: [What is the AI for Good idea in 1–2 sentences?]

Beginning:
Where does the story take place? Who is there? What’s the problem?

Middle:
How does the AI help? What changes?

End:
How does it end? Who benefits? What's the emotional payoff?

Message:
What is the lesson or message about AI for Good?
```

---

## 🧪 **Step 3: Generate a Storyboard with Copilot**

Paste your full prompt into **[Microsoft Create Stories](https://create.microsoft.com/stories)** or use Copilot in **PowerPoint/Word**.

> Copilot Prompt Example:
> “Write a storyboard based on this idea: AI helps calm shelter dogs through music. Include scenes, emotional beats, and visuals.”

✅ **Make sure to include:**

* 4–5 scenes
* Visual descriptions
* Emotional or human connection
* Problem → AI intervention → Positive outcome

---

## 🖼️ **Step 4: Modify or Add AI-Generated Images**

Use the images Copilot or Create gives you—or tweak them!

### 🖌️ Optional: Image Refinement Prompts

Paste these into Copilot in PowerPoint or Word:

* “Change the background to a forest during wildfire season.”
* “Add a worried student sitting with an AI-powered stress toy.”
* “Make the dog look calmer and curled up under a blanket.”

---

## 🎬 **Step 5: Create a Narrated Video in PowerPoint**

1. Add 1 storyboard image per slide.
2. Use Copilot in PowerPoint → “Create a narrated video.”
3. Ask Copilot to write narration using your storyboard prompt:

   > “Write narration for each slide based on this story: \[paste prompt].”
4. Generate & preview your AI video!

## 🌟 **Reflection Questions**

* What did you learn about **how to write good prompts**?
* What surprised you about Copilot’s ideas?
* What would you do differently next time?
* What message does your story send about AI’s role in our world?

## 🐾 Sample Project: Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs

**Concept:** An AI music player detects dogs' emotions through barking and tail movement. It plays calming music that helps soothe them.

**Beginning:** Busy shelter, dogs barking anxiously. A worker installs an AI speaker.

**Middle:** Music adapts to dog moods. Barking softens. A nervous pup curls up.

**End:** A family adopts the dog. At home, AI converts a voice message into calming music. Tail wags. Peace.

**Message:** AI can comfort and connect—even with those who can’t speak.
